With Explorr you can perform those three (or two, or five or more) searches simultaneously.

HTTPS version is also available and the URL gets updated with the tags you searched for, so you can easily bookmark the page.

Nationally, there were 124 million ED visits in 2011, of which the CDC estimates 50% could be handled in a primary care setting. With an average charge for each ED encounter approaching $700 vs. the average physician office charge of $150, every patient redirected away from the ED saves the payor $550. This represents a total potential market savings of $34 billion for facilitating correct use of primary care. 

Providing people with the tools they need to find appropriate care everywhere saves everyone, hospitals and patients, money and time.

Patients receive a SMS from triage.me post emergency room discharge. By sending a text to triage.me with their problem and current address, we route the person towards the nearest clinic, providing the address and a link to directions (for smartphone users).

Many clinics that work with the underinsured also often have variable hours and locations. We've made it easy for these clinics to update their hours and location via SMS so that we can better route triage.me users to locations."
